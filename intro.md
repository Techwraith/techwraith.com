This is a place for [essays](#essays). Long, sometimes incoherent, sometimes meandering, hopefully interesting and thought provoking essays. If you've been here before, you'll know what you're looking for and you can find it in the list below. If this is your first time here, I encourage you to continue reading this little intro so I can show you around.

Before we begin: *Hi, I'm Dan*. Most people on the internet know me as [Techwraith](https://twitter.com/techwraith). I build teams that are highly collaborative, autonomous, and are passionately focused on solving problems for real people. The engineering team at [Eaze](https://www.eaze.com) calls me their leader; I hope I'm doing a good job. I've been building products with technology for over a decade and I'd like to think I've learned a thing or two about systems for both people and computers.

After so much time doing things, its time to start documenting the things I've learned. All of that documentation lives here.
