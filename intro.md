_**Hi, I'm Dan.**_ I build things for people and computers. Most people on the internet know me as [@techwraith][2].

If you've read this before and you're looking for something specific, feel free to skip this introduction and browse below. If not, please read on.

_Before you jump in, let me tell you a bit about **what I do**_:

The engineering team at [Eaze][3] calls me their leader. My goal there is to build a team that is compassionate, collaborative, autonomous, and eager to solve problems for real people. It's my job to build a team that uses technology to help our business achieve its goals. Luckily, these two sides aren't at odds with each other.

I've been building products with teams of people who use technology to solve real-world problems for over a decade. I've learned a thing or two about what it takes to build great teams, products, and technologies. Its time to start documenting these things and I plan to keep that documentation here in essay form.
