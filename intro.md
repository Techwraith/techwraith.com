_Hi. I'm Dan._

I build [systems][1] for teams to help them do their best work.

Every great manager has three tools to help their team achieve their goals: **[people][2], [process][2], and [purpose][2]**.  Using these tools I can help you build systems to unlock the potential in your teams.

## People 
Which team will perform better: a team that can work brilliantly together, or a team of brilliant assholes? You built a team because you realize that you can't do everything yourself. Building and fostering the right team is the core of effective management. A team of people from different backgrounds will perform better than a team of people who are not. You can't build a diverse team without first building an inclusive environment. The goal is to foster good listening habits and clear communication skills to create a safe place in which the people on your team to thrive. When everyone on a team feels safe to express who they are and what they need to do, magic happens.  **I build teams who work brilliantly together**.

## Process
Do you know why roads have lines painted on them? You might guess that that there are fewer accidents when there are lines painted on the road, but you'd be wrong. Roads have lines painted on them to encourage faster driving. They're there to remove friction from the system so that individual drivers can get from point A to point B in the most optimal way possible. That's how I treat process. **Process isn't here to prevent mistakes. It's here to document how a team should to behave to get from point A to point B with the least amount of friction possible**.

## Purpose
Does your team know why they come into work every day? The people and the processes that make up a team will determine how they get their work done. Purpose is what gives a team it's "why". Purpose comes from two types of motivation: extrinsic and intrinsic.  **By defining, tracking, and iterating on these motivations, I help teams find their purpose and keep it top of mind**.
