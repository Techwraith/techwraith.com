_Before you jump in, let me tell you a bit about what I do and what I believe_:

<br/>

I lead the engineering team at [Eaze](https://www.eaze.com). My goal there is to build a team that is compassionate, collaborative, autonomous, and eager to solve problems for real people. It’s my job to build a team that uses technology to help our business achieve its goals. Luckily, my goal and my job aren’t at odds with each other.

<br/>

I’ve been building products with teams who use technology to solve real-world problems for over a decade. I’ve learned a thing or two about what it takes to build great teams, products, and technologies.

<br/>

I believe that a team that is made up of people from diverse backgrounds will perform better than a team of people who are not; that a diverse team cannot be built without actively practicing inclusion.

<br/>

I believe that a team of engineers with average technical skill who can work well together will outperform a team of brilliant assholes every time.

<br/>

I believe that the people build the process and the process builds the product.
