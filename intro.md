Most people put a feed of their latest posts on their home page.

If that's what you're looking for, you can find a [list of essays](#essays) that I've written below this introduction. You'll notice that there are no dates or any semblance of order to the list. That's intentional, I try to avoid topics that expire with time. If you've read this before and you're looking for something specific (or looking for something new to read), feel free to skip this and browse below. If not, please read on.

Before you jump in, introductions are in order:

_**Hi, I'm Dan.**_ I build things for people and computers. Most people on the internet know me as [@techwraith](https://twitter.com/techwraith).

The engineering team at [Eaze](https://www.eaze.com) calls me their leader. My goal there is to build a team that is compassionate, collaborative, autonomous, and eager to solve problems for real people. It's my job to build a team that uses technology to help our business achieve its goals. Luckily, these two sides aren't at odds with each other.

I've been building products with teams of people who use technology to solve real-world problems for over a decade. I've learned a thing or two about what it takes to build great teams, products, and technologies. Its time to start documenting these things and I plan to keep that documentation here in essay form.

I'm excited to start this journey. I hope you are too.
