_**Hi, I'm Dan.**_ I build [systems](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3828902-thinking-in-systems) for people and computers.

I lead the engineering team at [Eaze](https://www.eaze.com). My goal there is to build a team that is compassionate, collaborative, autonomous, and eager to solve problems for real people. Teams with these qualities are effective at building and operating high performance businesses.

Iâ€™ve been building products with teams who use technology to solve real-world problems for over a decade. In that time I've developed some core beliefs.

I believe that a team that is made up of people from diverse backgrounds will perform better than a team of people who are not; that a diverse team cannot be built without actively practicing inclusion.

I believe that a team of engineers with average technical skill who can work well together will outperform a team of brilliant assholes every time.

I believe that the people build the process and the process builds the product.
