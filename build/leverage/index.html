  <h1 class="essay-title">Leverage</h1><br/>
  <p>I’ve been thinking a lot about how I make decisions. I run a fast growing team that is iterating on a product that’s gaining users faster than you can count. Solid decision making skills are handy. Today I want to talk about the framework that I use the most: easy and effective <em>leverage</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Leverage:</strong> power or ability to act or to influence people,events, decisions, etc.;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m often approached by people on other teams asking about how we can make some idea happen. We do a lot with only a few people at work. It’s important to find a simple and easy solution to most of these one off requests. Difficulty can’t be our only metric for a match though, we also need our solution to be effective. I find that for most problems, there is some distinguishable bar for effectiveness. Once a solution passes that bar, finding a more effective solution isn’t worth it.</p>
<p>When I need to find an easy and effective solution, I’ll do a breadth-first search. It’s best not to put too much thought into each solution at this stage. I try to come up with as many solutions as I can and write them all down.</p>
<p>Then, I’ll list them all out on a chart with two axis. On the left, I’ve got difficulty (high to low) and on the bottom I’ve got effectiveness (low to high). It should look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://cldup.com/_BInZ0ngN2.png" alt="Easy and Effective"></p>
<p>My viable solutions will be in the top right quadrant.</p>
<p>Once I’ve got a list of viable options, I need to choose which one to move forward with. To make that choice, I have to think about what the solution will allow me to achieve in the future.</p>
<p>For each of the solutions that are both easy and effective, I list out the second and third order effects that this solution will have. What does it stop me from doing in the future? What opportunities does it open up?</p>
<p>I’m looking for a solution that is both easy and effective, that provides me with the most opportunity, and the least restrictions in the future. If I find this solution, I’ve found a solution with high leverage.</p>
<p><small>Notice some rough edges in this essay? It’s a rough draft, but I’m open by default. Expect to see edits soon.</small></p>
