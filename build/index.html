  <p><em><strong>Hi, I’m Dan.</strong></em> I build things for people and computers. Most people on the internet know me as <a href="https://twitter.com/techwraith">@techwraith</a>.</p>
<p>If you’ve read this before, feel free to skip this introduction and browse the list of essays below. If not, please read on.</p>
<p><em>Before you jump in, let me tell you a bit about <strong>what I do</strong> and <strong>what I believe</strong></em>:</p>
<p>I lead the engineering team at Eaze. My goal there is to build a team that is compassionate, collaborative, autonomous, and eager to solve problems for real people. It’s my job to build a team that uses technology to help our business achieve its goals. Luckily, my goal and my job aren’t at odds with each other.</p>
<p>I’ve been building products with teams who use technology to solve real-world problems for over a decade. I’ve learned a thing or two about what it takes to build great teams, products, and technologies.</p>
<p>I believe that a team that is made up of people from diverse backgrounds will perform better than a team of people who are not; that a diverse team cannot be built without actively practicing inclusion.</p>
<p>I believe that a team of engineers with average technical skill who can work well together will outperform a team of brilliant assholes every time.</p>
<p>I believe that the people build the process and the process builds the product.</p>
