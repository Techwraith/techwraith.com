  <p><em><strong>Hi, I’m Dan.</strong></em> I build things for people and computers. Most people on the internet know me as <a href="https://twitter.com/techwraith">@techwraith</a>.</p>
<p>If you’ve read this before, feel free to skip this introduction and browse the list of essays below. If not, please read on.</p>
<p><em>Before you jump in, let me tell you a bit about <strong>what I do</strong></em>:</p>
<p>The engineering team at <a href="https://www.eaze.com">Eaze</a> calls me their leader. My goal is to build a team that is compassionate, collaborative, autonomous, and eager to solve problems for real people. It’s my responsibility to build a team that uses technology to help our business achieve its goals. Luckily, my goal and my responsibility aren’t at odds with each other.</p>
<p>I’ve been building products with teams who use technology to solve real-world problems for over a decade. I’ve learned a thing or two about what it takes to build great teams, products, and technologies. Its time to start documenting these things and I plan to keep that documentation here in essay form.</p>
