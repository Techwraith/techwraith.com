  <p>This is a growing collection of <a href="#essays">essays</a>. Long, sometimes incoherent, sometimes meandering, hopefully interesting and thought provoking essays.</p>
<p>If you’ve been here before, you’ll know what you’re looking for and you can find it in the list below. If this is your first time here, I encourage you to continue reading this little intro so I can show you around.</p>
<p>Before we begin: <em>Hi, I’m Dan</em>. Most people on the internet know me as <a href="https://twitter.com/techwraith">Techwraith</a>. I build teams that are highly collaborative, autonomous, and are passionately focused on solving problems for real people. The engineering team at <a href="https://www.eaze.com">Eaze</a> calls me their leader; I hope I’m doing a good job. I’ve been building products with technology for over a decade and I’d like to think I’ve learned a thing or two about systems for both people and computers.</p>
<p>After so much time doing things, its time to start documenting the things I’ve learned. All of that documentation lives here.</p>
