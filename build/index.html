  <p><em><strong>Hi, I’m Dan.</strong></em> I build <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3828902-thinking-in-systems">systems</a> for people and computers.</p>
<p>I lead the engineering team at <a href="https://www.eaze.com">Eaze</a>. My goal there is to build a team that is compassionate, collaborative, autonomous, and eager to solve problems for real people. Teams with these qualities are effective at building and operating high performance businesses.</p>
<p>I’ve been building products with teams who use technology to solve real-world problems for over a decade. In that time I’ve developed some core beliefs.</p>
<p>I believe that a team that is made up of people from diverse backgrounds will perform better than a team of people who are not; that a diverse team cannot be built without actively practicing inclusion.</p>
<p>I believe that a team of engineers with average technical skill who can work well together will outperform a team of brilliant assholes every time.</p>
<p>I believe that the people build the process and the process builds the product.</p>
